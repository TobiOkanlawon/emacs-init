#My emacs config

Followed: https://unkertmedia.com/how-to-setup-emacs-for-web-development/ to get emacs ready for web development.

Got beancount mode for working with beancount -- A plain-text accounting program.
Download Beancount mode from: https://github.com/beancount/beancount-mode

The packages are pushed to the Git repo with the exception of the ones gotten from Github. Currently those are:

- beancount-mode

## INSTALLATION

To bootstrap this config on a new emacs installation:
  - clone the repo into ~/.emacs.d
  - install all the packages that have been gotten from git directly. Place them each in a folder with the same name as the package. E.g: beancount-mode -> ./beancount-mode/
  - Profit?
